# Vanilla JS OpenCrypto SPA üìàüìäüì∞

Welcome to OpenCrypto! I built this application because I was really excited about the idea of building the SPA without using any modern frameworks, and so I did it!. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this crypto dashboard just as much as I enjoyed building it.

## About The Project / Motivation üí°

- Why Vanilla JS ?

**First of all**, Javascript frameworks are awesome ! I love and use them for most of my projects.</br>
Why are they awesome ?</br> 
-- They help out by abstracting the hard code with complex structure . </br>
-- They help to focus on the app's value rather in its implementation </br>
-- They help to significantly decrease the code-writing time</br>
-- They help newcomers in your company to hop into the project very fast and with great confidenc—É,without needing to explain every part of your software architecture
</br>

**However**, with all its greateness, when something goes wrong and you don't why (which is natural thing that happens a lot) because you don't have a deep understanding of JS, then my friend you are in a big trouble. </br>
Angular, React, Vue, Ember, Next, Meteor,Koa... are awesome iff you understand its core engineering principles which in turn requires a good understanding of Vanilla JS. After all, we should try to be a developer, not [put your favourite framework here] developer.

**Hence**, taking into considerations all the aforementioned thoughts, I decided to write the simple,yet very interesting project, in order to learn and practice Vanilla JS.

## How to run / Setup üî©
**To use the app with only the main functionality**, you can follow the link: https://nodirbeknabiev98.github.io/OpenCrypto/

**To use the app with <u>full functionality</u>**, you should download the project source code and follow the instructions below<br>
- Open /javascript/env/env-config.js 
- Add environmental variables
  - `KEY_exchangerateapi="###############";` <br>
  The KEY_exchangerateapi is the API key received from registering at 
https://www.exchangerate-api.com/<br>
  - `KEY_openweathermap="###############";` </br> 
  The KEY_openweathermap is the API key received from registering at 
  https://openweathermap.org/api <br>
- Open With Live Server 
  - `index.html`

**Additional Notes**
  - No external dependencies are required
  - Use Google Chrome and VS Code Live Server
  
## FAQ/Common errors üôã
<b>Question:</b> Why do I need to use VS Code Live Server? You said that the project is built using Vanilla JS, why can't I just open it using the browser directly and run the project ? </br>
<b>Answer:</b> You need to pay attention to local testing ‚Äî if you try to load the HTML file locally (i.e.
with a file:// URL), you'll run into CORS errors due to JavaScript module security
requirements. You need to do your testing through a server. ES6 modules are subject to same-origin policy, opening the file directly with a browser will not work.

<b>Question:</b> Can I run the project using the other server? </br>
<b>Answer:</b> Absolutely! For example, you can use e.g "node static server" or "node live server". However, I run and tested this project only by using VS Code Live Server. If you can figure it out how to run it with different server, please do it.

<b>Question:</b> What if I run the project without adding API keys? (only the main functionality option) </br>
<b>Answer:</b> Well, only 3 modules of this application (currencyCards, weatherWidget, currencyConverter) require API keys to function. So, if you don't set up the API keys, then that 3 modules will not be functional and all the other parts will work good.
